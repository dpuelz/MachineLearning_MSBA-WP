## Week 4 assignment

This assignment focuses on conditioning and the "mixture rule", ie, the rule of total probability.  

1. Visitors to your website are asked to answer a single survey question before they get access to the content on the page. Among all of the users, there are two categories: Random Clicker (RC), and Truthful Clicker (TC). There are two possible answers to the survey: yes and no. Random clickers would click either one with equal probability. You are also giving the information that the expected fraction of random clickers is 0.3.  After a trial period, you get the following survey results: 65\% said Yes and 35\% said No.   What fraction of people who are truthful clickers answered yes?  Hint: use the rule of total probability.  

2. Imagine a medical test for a disease with the following two attributes:  

- The sensitivity is about 0.993. That is, if someone has the disease, there is a probability of 0.993 that they will test positive.  
- The specificity is about 0.9999. This means that if someone doesn't have the disease, there is probability of 0.9999 that they will test negative.  
- In the general population, incidence of the disease is reasonably rare: about 0.0025% of all people have it (or 0.000025 as a decimal probability).

Suppose someone tests positive. What is the probability that they have the disease?
